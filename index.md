## About me

My name is Jingbang Chen. I am currently pursuing Ph.D of Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology under the guidance of [Richard Peng](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~rpeng/). Prior to this, I received my B.Eng (Honors) at Zhejiang University, under the guidance of [Can Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/wangcan).

I am highly involved with Competitive Programming since high school. I received a Bronze Medal in National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI) in 2015. Then I joined the Competitive Programming Team of Zhejiang University and served as the team leader of Team [Legilimens](http://codeforces.com/team/32489) (2017-2019) and the student co-coach (2018-2019). During my undergraduate life, I won 12 gold medals in [ICPC](https://icpc.global/), [CCPC](https://ccpc.io/) series competitions including the very first Regional Champion of Zhejiang University in 2017 and the Provincial Champion in 2018. On behalf of Zhejiang University, I participated in ICPC World Finals held in Beijing, 2018. During my first year in Georgia Tech, I won the Champion of Southeast USA Regional and Second Runner-up in North America Championship. Therefore, I will participate in ICPC World Finals 2021. I am International Grandmaster at [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/profile/chenjb) (Max Rating 2735). I also work as a problem setter, judge or advisor for multiple contests and training camps.

My current research field is Theoretical Computer Science (TCS).
